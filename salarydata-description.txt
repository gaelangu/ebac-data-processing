|
| Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of
|   reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions:
|   ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
|
| Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
|
| Following algorithms were run with the following error rates,

| Description of fnlwgt (final weight)
|
| The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the
| civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly
| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of
| controls.
|  These are:
|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.
|
| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through
| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.
|
| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating
| "weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population.
|
| People with similar demographic characteristics should have
| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember
| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is
| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own
| probability of selection, the statement only applies within
| state.
